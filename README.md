# Background
I don't know if it's allowed to share the assignment specification on github so it is not included but the main objectives of the assignment were to create 3 modes:  
* obstacle avoidance  
* line following (ellipse track)  
* line following (rectangle track)  

It is described in more detail in the report.   

# Useful bits of code
If you're making a project based on EMoRo2560 robot (using GLAM module) then the following files may come handy to you:  
* bluetooth.cpp / .h    
* drive.cpp / .h  
* display.cpp / .h
